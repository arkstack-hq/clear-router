## Features

- Simple and clean route declarations (get, post, put, delete, patch, options, head)
- Grouped routes with prefix
- Middleware stack: per-route and group-level
- Controller-method pair as route handler
- Supports HttpContext style handlers: { req, res, next }
- Function handlers always receive context as first argument
- Controller handlers receive hydrated `this.body`, `this.query`, `this.params`, and `this.clearRequest`
- `clearRequest` is passed as second handler argument for controller handlers
- Auto-binds controller methods
- Full CommonJS, ESM, and TypeScript support
- Error handling delegated to Express | H3
- Route inspection with the `allRoutes` method
- Fully Express-compatible
- Fully H3-compatible

## Quick Start

### Express JS

See the [Express JS documentation](./docs/EXPRESS.md) for details.

### H3

See the [H3 documentation](./docs/H3.md) for details.

## API Reference

See [API.md](./docs/API.md) for complete API documentation.

## Middleware Execution Order

```txt
[ Global Middleware ] → [ Group Middleware ] → [ Route Middleware ]
```

## Handler Execution

- If function: executed directly
- If [Controller, 'method']: auto-instantiated (if needed), method is called
- First handler arg is always context (`{ req, res, next }` for Express, H3 event for H3)
- Second handler arg is `clearRequest` for controller handlers

## Testing

npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:cjs      # Test CommonJS
npm run test:esm      # Test ESM
npm run test:ts       # Test TypeScript
```

See [TESTING.md](./docs/TESTING.md) for a detailed testing guide.
